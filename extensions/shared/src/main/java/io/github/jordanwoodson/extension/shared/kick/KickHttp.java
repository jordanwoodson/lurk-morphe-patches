/**
 * Kick's own API requests, for two switches. 7TV emotes reads which channel a chat belongs to: 7TV looks emotes up by
 * the channel owner's Kick user ID, and Kick's chat page only knows the channel ID. Kick's own channel responses give
 * the channel's slug for its ID, which leads to the owner; they are only read, never changed. Anonymous chat refuses
 * the requests that post to chat (a message, a reply or a quick emote, and a celebration's action, which can post
 * one), so nothing is sent as you while the chat page reads chat as a guest. The only extension class that names
 * OkHttp, which Kick ships unrenamed; Twitch and Rumble never load it.
